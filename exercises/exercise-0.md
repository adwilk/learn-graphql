### Exercise 0 - GraphQL Basics

The goal of this exercise is to understand the basics of graphql. This includes:

* [Types](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/basic-types/)
* [Resolvers](http://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers)
* [Schema](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/)


At the end of this exercise you should have graphql configured with a node express server. You should also be able to hit your express endpoint with a query string `?query={hello}` and return 'Hello World'.
